            <h2>Bread Waste Problem</h2>
            <p>Can you believe that bread – that most useful of staples – is the food we throw away most often? 
               Studies indicate that produce (fruits and vegetables), 
               breads and cereals are the most wasted food groups in Canadian homes. 
               A whopping 24 million slices get thrown in the bin every day in the Canada – and that's just from our homes. 
               The good news is we're getting better: that figure is more than a third less than we were throwing away in 2007 – but it's still a massive waste!
               Bread is one of the cornerstones of many people’s diets. We don't like to run out of staple foods, such as bread and milk, we buy some 'just in case'. Most of the bread that ends up in the bin has either gone past the date shown on its wrapper, or we think it has 'gone off'.

            <h2>Oversupply of Bread</h2>
            <p>Recent research estimates that 20% (or 11 million tonnes) of all the food produced in 
               Canada annually becomes avoidable food loss or waste – food that could have been eaten, 
               but was instead landfilled, incinerated or managed as organic waste (VCMI, 2019). 
               Globally, around a third of all the food produced is wasted, and food waste accounts for 6% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. 
               There are few reliable statistics on bread waste, though some estimates place bread waste at around 30%.
               As a nation, we’re making too much bread. Exactly how much is hard to say, 
               but some estimate that one-third of all the bread made in America goes to waste. 
               In their roadmap to less food waste, ReFED reported that grain products constitute 19 percent of food waste in our country. 
               In New York City, City Harvest redistributed 5.1 million pounds of bread in 2016, or almost 10 percent of the food they collected.

            <h2>Consumer Behavior</h2>
            <p>Today, bread waste is one of the most important social problems. 
               It is known that consumer behavior changes in proportion to income level. 
               Because we don't like to run out of staple foods, such as bread and milk, we buy some 'just in case'. 
               Most of the bread that ends up in the bin has either gone past the date shown on its wrapper, or we think it has 'gone off'.
               At the high-income level, bread waste is usually caused by stale bread, and this also means the trash of national income. 
               Most bread waste occurs in households in which consumers play a role. It always sells in the big loaf, yet, comes with short shelf life, which easily creates waste. As the number of individuals in the family increases, the amount of bread bought increases in parallel.
